        <h1> CEB Cryptography Simulator </h1>
        <h3> WHAT WE DO:</h3>
        <p> This website is designed to help you better understand ciphers and encryptions algorithms. If you scroll down, you can find definitions for common cryptology terms and in-depth 
            explainations on what ciphers are and how they work. You also have the ability to play around with our encryption tools. We have a simulation for <a href="ciphers.html">common 
            ciphers</a> and <a href="aesDes.html">AES and DES algroithms</a>. You can even build your own custom encryption algorithm on the <a href="customAlgorithm.html">Build Your Own Algorithm</a>
            page! Our goal is to help you visualize what's going on and learn by doing. Feel free to experiment with the different settings to truly understand what's going on behind the
            scenes. Building your own encryption algorithm can also help you understand how complex these algorithms truly are and get an idea of all the nitty gritty math that goes on 
            behind the scenes. Get ready to learn because with these resources, we'll get you to a crypto expert in no time!

            Online, there are many free websites out there that help students learn, but oftentimes they lack structure or efficient tools. This website is meant to be an all inclusive 
            experience for users. They can find everything they need to understand the concept, all in one place. Because it orientated around a specific topic, this website is albe to cover
            more information and dive deeper into the topic itself. The tools, like Build Your Own Algorithm also allow students to understand what's going on behind the scenes.
